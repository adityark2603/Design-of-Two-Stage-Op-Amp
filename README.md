# Two-Stage-Op-Amp-CMOS-Design

A Two-Stage OpAmp is a commonly used CMOS amplifier architecture that offers high gain and wide output swing, making it suitable for a variety of analog applications.

### Structure:
1. First Stage (Differential Amplifier):
Provides high gain and amplifies the differential input signal.
2. Second Stage (Common-Source Amplifier):
Increases overall gain and provides sufficient output swing.

### Performance Parameter Results:
